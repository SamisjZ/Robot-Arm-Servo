controlling servo motors for robot arm project with smart methods company

this is the electronic part of the robot arm project
using 5 servo motors to control the joints of the robot arm  using potentiometer in 90 degrees range


see the circuit connections  of the servo motors with potentiometer in this file "servo arm circuit diagram.png"
in the circuit:
1- I connect all the servo motors to the power +battry and -battry and the GND of arduino to -battry and connect them to the arduino PWM pins (3,5,6,9,10,11) .
2- connecting the power +battry and -battry to the terminal 1 and 2 of the Potentiometer, then connect the wiper of the potentiometer in analog pins (5,4,3,2,1).

in the code file "servo_Arm.ino" you will find a discription for the steps.

"servo arm circuit.brd" is ciruit file need eagle autodisk or altium 365 or any program read the extrintion .brd
